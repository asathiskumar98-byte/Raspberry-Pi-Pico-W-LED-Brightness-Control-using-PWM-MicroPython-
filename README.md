# üí° Raspberry Pi Pico W ‚Äì LED Brightness Control using PWM (MicroPython)

This project demonstrates how to control the **brightness of an LED** using **PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)** on the **Raspberry Pi Pico W**, programmed in **MicroPython** via **Thonny IDE**.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è What is PWM?
**PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)** rapidly switches a digital output between HIGH and LOW.  
By adjusting how long the signal stays HIGH (the **duty cycle**), you can simulate an analog voltage ‚Äî controlling LED brightness, motor speed, or audio tone intensity.

- **0% Duty Cycle (0)** ‚Üí LED OFF  
- **100% Duty Cycle (65535)** ‚Üí LED FULL ON
